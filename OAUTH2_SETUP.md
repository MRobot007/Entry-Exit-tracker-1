# OAuth2 Setup Guide for Google Sheets Integration

This guide will help you set up OAuth2 authentication to enable full read/write access to Google Sheets.

## Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Sheets API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

## Step 2: Create OAuth2 Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Choose "Web application"
4. Set the following:
   - **Name**: "Entry Exit Tracker"
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**: 
     - `http://localhost:5173` (for development)
     - `http://localhost:3000` (if using different port)
     - Add your production domain when ready
   - **Authorized redirect URIs**:
     - `http://localhost:5173/oauth2/callback`
     - `http://localhost:3000/oauth2/callback`
     - Add your production callback URL when ready

## Step 3: Get Your Client ID

1. After creating the OAuth2 client, copy the **Client ID**
2. It will look like: `123456789-abcdefghijklmnop.apps.googleusercontent.com`

## Step 4: Update Your Code

1. Open `src/lib/googleSheets.ts`
2. Find this line:
   ```typescript
   const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com';
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com` with your actual Client ID

## Step 5: Test the Setup

1. Start your application: `npm run dev`
2. Go to your dashboard
3. Try adding a person or recording an entry
4. You should see a Google OAuth2 popup
5. Sign in with your Google account
6. Grant permissions to access your Google Sheets

## Step 6: Verify It's Working

1. Check your Google Spreadsheet
2. You should now see data being written to the "Entries" and "People" sheets
3. The app will show "âœ… Entry added to Google Sheets via OAuth2" in the console

## Troubleshooting

### Popup Blocked
- Make sure popups are allowed for your domain
- Check that the redirect URI matches exactly

### Authentication Failed
- Verify your Client ID is correct
- Check that the Google Sheets API is enabled
- Ensure your redirect URIs are properly configured

### Still Not Working
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your Google account has access to the spreadsheet
- Make sure the spreadsheet is shared with your Google account

## Security Notes

- Keep your Client ID secure
- Don't commit it to public repositories
- Use environment variables in production
- Regularly review and revoke unused tokens

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. Update the authorized origins and redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console
2. Use environment variables for the Client ID
3. Set up proper HTTPS
4. Consider using a service account for server-side operations

## Environment Variables (Recommended)

Create a `.env` file:
```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
```

Then update the code to use:
```typescript
const CLIENT_ID = import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID;
```

This keeps your credentials secure and makes deployment easier.

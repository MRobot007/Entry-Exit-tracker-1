The application will automatically create the required sheets, but you can also create them manually:

**People Sheet** (for student registrations):
- Headers: ID, Name, Enrollment No, Email, Phone, Course, Branch, Semester, Created Date, Created Time

**Entry Sheets** (one for each course/branch combination):
- Headers: Date, Time, Type, Person Name, Enrollment No, Course, Branch, Semester

2. Click "Change to anyone with the link"
3. Set permission to "Viewer"
4. Click "Done"

### 3. Google Cloud Console Setup

2. Search for "Google Sheets API" and enable it

#### Step 3: Create Credentials
1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
3. Copy the API key
4. (Optional) Restrict the API key for security

#### Step 4: OAuth2 Setup (Optional)
1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"

4. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:8080/oauth2/callback` (for development)
   - `https://yourdomain.com/oauth2/callback` (for production)
5. Copy the Client ID

### 4. Installation & Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
